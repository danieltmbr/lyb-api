# Lyb
**\#quick-and-dirty #passion-project**

Lyb is (will be - ðŸš§ still under construction) a lyrics application which persists lyrics to local storage.
The idea is driven by the frustration of London underground where no network is available hence reading something or listening to something are the only options. Combining these to activity would be great, but with on-demand lyrics services it's just not possible.

### Service

Lyb Api enables clients to search for a song with its information and also scrapes its lyrics if available.
The service is backed by [Genius Api](https://docs.genius.com) and lyrics scraping is using a method described in Will Soares' [blogpost](https://dev.to/willamesoares/how-to-integrate-spotify-and-genius-api-to-easily-crawl-song-lyrics-with-python-4o62).
